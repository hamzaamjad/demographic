# Demographic Project
The goal of this project is to extract data from various U.S. demographic data providers, and use LLMs/AI to generate a PDF report automatically using the demographic data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will be the first provider used in the project, with the goal of replicating "The Employment Situation".
